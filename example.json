Our intense reactions are more a force of habit than anything so it's necessary to break the habit by catching yourself getting lost in your feelings and making a deliberate effort to change the reaction. Acknowledge what it is you're feeling, but not to identify with that feeling, and then change your relationship to that feeling. For example, \"I feel hopeless\" turns into \"I feel hurt/sad/scared, and this is temporary\" and then turn your attention to action, whether that's journaling to purge the feeling, reading a book/practicing a hobby/watching a movie to shift your focus away from the feeling, or something else entirely. As long as it's something that prevents you from treating your feeling like it's fundamentally who you are. \n\nWhen someone says \"stop\", essentially it means that you've acknowledged that you feel \\[BLANK\\], now recognize it as a feeling, and ground yourself in your body, in the present. Usually focusing on breathing is the easiest.  And then shift to a constructive action that will comfort you or build your self-esteem/distress tolerance. The particulars of this are going to look different for everyone and it is trial and error.

Our intense reactions are more a force of habit than anything so it&amp;#39;s necessary to break the habit by catching yourself getting lost in your feelings and making a deliberate effort to change the reaction. Acknowledge what it is you&amp;#39;re feeling, but not to identify with that feeling, and then change your relationship to that feeling. For example, &amp;quot;I feel hopeless&amp;quot; turns into &amp;quot;I feel hurt/sad/scared, and this is temporary&amp;quot; and then turn your attention to action, whether that&amp;#39;s journaling to purge the feeling, reading a book/practicing a hobby/watching a movie to shift your focus away from the feeling, or something else entirely. As long as it&amp;#39;s something that prevents you from treating your feeling like it&amp;#39;s fundamentally who you are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When someone says &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot;, essentially it means that you&amp;#39;ve acknowledged that you feel [BLANK], now recognize it as a feeling, and ground yourself in your body, in the present. Usually focusing on breathing is the easiest.  And then shift to a constructive action that will comfort you or build your self-esteem/distress tolerance. The particulars of this are going to look different for everyone and it is trial and error. It won&amp;#39;t work perfectly every single time, but you do have to try it every single time to reprogram your automatic response into one that is more manageable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope I&amp;#39;ve been clear.

It\u2019s truly so exciting, since current antidepressants only work in about 30% of people. We are badly in need of new treatment options. \n\nI\u2019ve used mushrooms multiple times, following the Johns Hopkins psychedelic study protocol. They have a certain playlist (on Spotify) that is mostly classical and spiritual music and the songs are based off scientific research which shows that they elicit powerful and emotional visions and feelings. And it\u2019s like years of therapy in just a few hours. I\u2019ve taken journeys back to childhood, had breakthroughs about my family, come to terms with trauma...it has been truly incredible. I don\u2019t do mushrooms for fun, it\u2019s actually anything but fun. I do them with the intention of treating my illness. By the end of a few hours I\u2019ve sobbed hysterically, laughed, connected with my spiritual side, and had visions of changes that I needed in my life along with having a deeper understanding. \n\nGranted I still take meds and do therapy, but the journeys I\u2019ve been on have had long lasting, profound, positive effects. I\u2019m 35 and a professional with a graduate degree, happy marriage, money, and cats...so I\u2019m not what one would think of when they think about psychedelics\u2014the stereotype about burnouts and hippies is false. \n\nI\u2019m not promoting drug use here, I\u2019m just curious if others have been following the research, the news articles, or have done it themselves. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard much about psychedelics treating depression, just google it. There\u2019s been multiple articles in the news in the past few weeks and I\u2019ve been following it for the past couple years.",

By the end of a few hours I\u2019ve sobbed hysterically, laughed, connected with my spiritual side, and had visions of changes that I needed in my life along with having a deeper understanding. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Granted I still take meds and do therapy, but the journeys I\u2019ve been on have had long lasting, profound, positive effects. I\u2019m 35 and a professional with a graduate degree, happy marriage, money, and cats...so I\u2019m not what one would think of when they think about psychedelics\u2014the stereotype about burnouts and hippies is false. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not promoting drug use here, I\u2019m just curious if others have been following the research, the news articles, or have done it themselves. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you haven\u2019t heard much about psychedelics treating depression, just google it. There\u2019s been multiple articles in the news in the past few weeks and I\u2019ve been following it for the past couple years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I can also feign interest in things very easily in order to blend into social groups and situations.\n     However, this has left my with a deep sense of emptyness in my life, I feel like I'm free falling through life with nothing to cling onto and no direction. I'm 24 and since leaving school 6 years ago I have basically had a different career path every year since then, that being switching between college courses or employment, from working in finance, being a gym instructor, briefly studying politics, to wanting to become a chef. I have nothing to show for my life thus far and fear I never will due to lacking sense of self, and peers my age already have career and financial stability whereas I do not as I just don't know what to do and I don't really know who am I and what I want to do.",

I don\u2019t want to be that shadow to people who genuinely cared for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t even know why I am writing this. I wish life turned out better for you too mom. I wished you looked for help when you were depressed back then too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about this for a really long time. Why would anyone love me when I am such a mess. And why bother living when you are not enjoying life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I can talk to a psychiatrist and explicitly say I do not think I will ever hurt or kill myself, and my parent can be with me and literally say I would be safe at home and yet they can still decide to force me in one for a few days. This happened and I had no intention of going to one at the time and was terrified, I was crying and trying to run away and they grabbed me by each arm and leg, throwing me on a hospital bed yelling at me to lay down on it, and said \u201cmy little outburst was proving that I need this.\u201d Having to spend those days alone with my thoughts, away from everyone who cares about me, unable to sleep because of the shitty beds, being treated like I\u2019m insane all because I \u201cdidn\u2019t want to hurt anymore but didn\u2019t want to kill myself either and knew I never would.\u201d Literally the only way it helped was I appreciated normal life a lot more for the next few days after I got out, though I also felt kinda traumatized and had the worst insomnia of my life ultimately leading me to feel much worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can understand how something like that might be necessary for someone who is dangerously at risk of hurting themselves or someone else but god for the most part it really seems like a fucked up system.

                    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I'm looking for an open, honest conversation about marijuana use in individuals diagnosed with bpd.\n(I apologize in advance for the long post).\nI was diagnosed bpd last year, and have been struggling with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. \nI never really smoked marijuana when I was younger (I'm 38f). I tried it a couple times in my teenage years for fun, but that's about it, until recent years...\nI started smoking marijuana on a nightly basis about 3 years prior to my diagnosis, as I heard it worked great for insomnia. It absolutely worked wonders, as I hadn't slept so amazingly in all my life. This nightly routine slowly turned into twice a day, then every couple hours throughout the day on weekends, and every couple of  hours during the evenings after work on the week days.\nI started to do things again, to be more active around the house, more loving towards my kids, no longer yelling or arguing every single day. I became more outgoing at work, being able to have conversations with anyone I wanted without the fear of messing up or questioning my every move over and over in my head. I started having a lot more positive moments instead of always feeling empty or down.\nI felt stronger in my own skin. I could stand up for myself and speak out, instead of always having to hide my emotions or feelings. I could finally remove the \"mask\", as I always felt like I had to put one on when stepping out of my house. No more tears, I felt alive again! I finally felt like I belonged and I was normal. \nOnce I started to see a psychiatrist, I was advised to stop using marijuana as it is very bad for this specific  disorder.  It causes symptoms to become worse the doctors advised... and that there are only negatives with marijuana use and bpd . \nI've seen 2 different psychiatrists which have both said the same thing, along with my family doctor. \nSo, I did it, off and on for a bit until about 2 months ago when I gave up marijuana completely. I only take my prescribed medications. Its been a couple months and I feel as if I'm going back to my old self, my old ways, my anger is back, my emptiness... my mind is everywhere but where it needs to be.\nBeing diagnosed bpd I know there is no cure, I know there are no pills to magically make me cured. It takes hard work and therapy.  But the fact that doctors keep prescribing me different medications that only mildly help some of my symptoms or just fuck me up even more or make my hair fall out or make me go missing for a day sitting in my car in a park, freaking the hell out of my husband and kids. I don't know, I just don't get it... Why push all of these big pharma pills with so many known risks and side effects which we know won't actually cure my personality disorder, but may manage some of the symptoms instead of something natural which actually works and makes life worth living? I get that everyone has different views on marijuana use, and I know the research isn't close to where it needs to be, but to my experience and which others have witnessed in me, I function more normally when using marijuana than without. I've explained to my psychiatrist and my family doctor about these feelings and symptoms but have been told that I just need to stay away from marijuana and I will see the benefits.... it just takes time!.... I'm still patiently waiting, and my poor husband has to take all the heat and craziness in the meantime.\nI wasn't using marijuana in all the years prior and have struggled my whole life with a whole lot of crazy...\nSo I would like to know what other's experiences are with marijuana and bpd. Has anyone else seen benefits or changes in their lives? Any thoughts or opinions are more than welcome.... thank you for listening to my rant!",

I tried it a couple times in my teenage years for fun, but that&amp;#39;s about it, until recent years...\nI started smoking marijuana on a nightly basis about 3 years prior to my diagnosis, as I heard it worked great for insomnia. It absolutely worked wonders, as I hadn&amp;#39;t slept so amazingly in all my life. This nightly routine slowly turned into twice a day, then every couple hours throughout the day on weekends, and every couple of  hours during the evenings after work on the week days.\nI started to do things again, to be more active around the house, more loving towards my kids, no longer yelling or arguing every single day. I became more outgoing at work, being able to have conversations with anyone I wanted without the fear of messing up or questioning my every move over and over in my head. I started having a lot more positive moments instead of always feeling empty or down.\nI felt stronger in my own skin. I could stand up for myself and speak out, instead of always having to hide my emotions or feelings. I could finally remove the &amp;quot;mask&amp;quot;, as I always felt like I had to put one on when stepping out of my house. No more tears, I felt alive again! I finally felt like I belonged and I was normal. \nOnce I started to see a psychiatrist, I was advised to stop using marijuana as it is very bad for this specific  disorder.  It causes symptoms to become worse the doctors advised... and that there are only negatives with marijuana use and bpd . \nI&amp;#39;ve seen 2 different psychiatrists which have both said the same thing, along with my family doctor. \nSo, I did it, off and on for a bit until about 2 months ago when I gave up marijuana completely. I only take my prescribed medications. Its been a couple months and I feel as if I&amp;#39;m going back to my old self, my old ways, my anger is back, my emptiness... my mind is everywhere but where it needs to be.\nBeing diagnosed bpd I know there is no cure, I know there are no pills to magically make me cured. It takes hard work and therapy.  But the fact that doctors keep prescribing me different medications that only mildly help some of my symptoms or just fuck me up even more or make my hair fall out or make me go missing for a day sitting in my car in a park, freaking the hell out of my husband and kids. I don&amp;#39;t know, I just don&amp;#39;t get it... Why push all of these big pharma pills with so many known risks and side effects which we know won&amp;#39;t actually cure my personality disorder, but may manage some of the symptoms instead of something natural which actually works and makes life worth living? I get that everyone has different views on marijuana use, and I know the research isn&amp;#39;t close to where it needs to be, but to my experience and which others have witnessed in me, I function more normally when using marijuana than without. I&amp;#39;ve explained to my psychiatrist and my family doctor about these feelings and symptoms but have been told that I just need to stay away from marijuana and I will see the benefits.... it just takes time!.... I&amp;#39;m still patiently waiting, and my poor husband has to take all the heat and craziness in the meantime.\nI wasn&amp;#39;t using marijuana in all the years prior and have struggled my whole life with a whole lot of crazy...\nSo I would like to know what other&amp;#39;s experiences are with marijuana and bpd. Has anyone else seen benefits or changes in their lives? Any thoughts or opinions are more than welcome.... thank you for listening to my rant!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I have absolutely no one, and it\u2019s all my fault. I can pinpoint the things that go wrong, but no matter how much I try to change them, the patterns keep recurring.\n\nI actively pursue bad people, and then purposely ignore the red flags. This ends with me getting hurt by their actions. Sometimes i\u2019m able to cut ties and leave, but i\u2019m left with a lingering sadness for months afterwards, because I miss the dynamic of whatever relationship i\u2019d built with them. Other times, I find myself in situations that I can\u2019t escape without taking drastic measures, then i\u2019m forced to look back and realise that the actions taken by the other person may not have been my fault, but i\u2019m the one that got myself into the mess in the first place. \n\nOn the rare occasion that I manage to find a good person, I become so stupidly obsessed with them that I end up pushing them away. I either assume they\u2019ll leave and put up an abusive defence mechanism, or I become so clingy that they can\u2019t cope and leave on their own accord. \n\nI struggle with promiscuity and hyper sexuality, so I often confuse the lines between wanting friends and wanting someone to shower me with attention. It\u2019s as if I don\u2019t feel good about myself unless someone wants me. This creates a lot of issues, as I switch drastically between \u201cwhy don\u2019t you want to have sex with me?\u201d and \u201cwhy do you only want me for sex?\u201d\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019ve tried making friends in person, through apps, through subreddits, but I always struggle due to the points mentioned above. I\u2019m so fucking lonely, and it\u2019s making me miserable.\n\nI don\u2019t know if i\u2019m looking for advice, or if i\u2019m just looking to get my thoughts out into the open.

I have absolutely no one, and it\u2019s all my fault. I can pinpoint the things that go wrong, but no matter how much I try to change them, the patterns keep recurring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actively pursue bad people, and then purposely ignore the red flags. This ends with me getting hurt by their actions. Sometimes i\u2019m able to cut ties and leave, but i\u2019m left with a lingering sadness for months afterwards, because I miss the dynamic of whatever relationship i\u2019d built with them. Other times, I find myself in situations that I can\u2019t escape without taking drastic measures, then i\u2019m forced to look back and realise that the actions taken by the other person may not have been my fault, but i\u2019m the one that got myself into the mess in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the rare occasion that I manage to find a good person, I become so stupidly obsessed with them that I end up pushing them away. I either assume they\u2019ll leave and put up an abusive defence mechanism, or I become so clingy that they can\u2019t cope and leave on their own accord. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I struggle with promiscuity and hyper sexuality, so I often confuse the lines between wanting friends and wanting someone to shower me with attention. It\u2019s as if I don\u2019t feel good about myself unless someone wants me. This creates a lot of issues, as I switch drastically between \u201cwhy don\u2019t you want to have sex with me?\u201d and \u201cwhy do you only want me for sex?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019ve tried making friends in person, through apps, through subreddits, but I always struggle due to the points mentioned above. I\u2019m so fucking lonely, and it\u2019s making me miserable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know if i\u2019m looking for advice, or if i\u2019m just looking to get my thoughts out into the open. I don\u2019t really know much of anything anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

But then imagine you've broken your arm in a way that no one else can see or even understand - suddenly those little love taps are agony.\n\nThis means the pain you are feeling is not from 'new' wounds - it's the same wound, getting poked at.  I don't have a quick fix answer, but I think the first step is in acknowledging this wound and accepting it almost like a burden - which is what I have done.\n\nI can get terrifically triggered over any sense of 'injustice', and this is frankly because I feel there was a terrible lack of justice in the trauma that I survived.  So - I'm semi-permanently angry.  Without batting an eye I can flat out tell people that I want to kill them - if rage is a scale of 10, I have auto-access to 11.\n\nWhat's helped me scale it back is just being \\*very\\* aware of it.  I even sometimes make fun of my handicap - I acknowledge it.  It's just a part of me for the time being.  It's not appropriate that I make spontaneous death threats (lol), and so I strive not to, but when I have the urge I \\*know\\* where it's coming from and that seems to help somewhat.\n\nSo - you're not weak, and you're not 'sensitive' in a traditional sense.  What you are, is wounded.  When you feel these strong emotions from something negative, consciously acknowledge that it is your wound that is throbbing in agony, and not specifically you.  With this in understanding, perhaps it might be a little easier to bear - we both know the agony comes and goes.  You just have to bear it when it rears its ugly head and wait for it to pass (easier said than done I know).\n\nI don't know if any of my rambling here helped however I do hope you feel better.",

I\u2019ve tried all the tricks- deodorant, glide, squirrels nut butter, bike shorts, etc. Bike shorts work the best but are so hot and always bunch up. \n\nToday I went searching for my bike shorts while I was running late to work, I thought I found them but it turned out to be my fianc\u00e9\u2019s cool max boxer briefs. Since I was about to be 15 minutes late to work I didn\u2019t want to waste another minute looking for my shorts, so I put on the boxer briefs as shorts. 10/10 recommend! Why don\u2019t they make these specifically for women too? My thighs aren\u2019t rubbing, I\u2019m not hot from the thick material of bike shorts, I don\u2019t have that awful bunching at the waist.

I\u2019ve always had thick thighs from muscles developed through hours of no stirrup work while horseback riding. Unfortunately this means my thighs rub. I\u2019ve tried all the tricks- deodorant, glide, squirrels nut butter, bike shorts, etc. Bike shorts work the best but are so hot and always bunch up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I went searching for my bike shorts while I was running late to work, I thought I found them but it turned out to be my fianc\u00e9\u2019s cool max boxer briefs. Since I was about to be 15 minutes late to work I didn\u2019t want to waste another minute looking for my shorts, so I put on the boxer briefs as shorts. 10/10 recommend! Why don\u2019t they make these specifically for women too? My thighs aren\u2019t rubbing, I\u2019m not hot from the thick material of bike shorts, I don\u2019t have that awful bunching at the waist. Perfect. Thought I\u2019d share in case it helps anyone else!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Some of them may have IAP's but EXCLUSIVELY to unlock the full game or remove ads (no energy/gambling mechanics, no \"diamond-buy\" or cash grabbing bullshits of sort). I'm planning to keep it updated with the new games I'll play and like or old games I've played that will come to my mind later.

Some of them may have IAP&amp;#39;s but EXCLUSIVELY to unlock the full game or remove ads (no energy/gambling mechanics, no &amp;quot;diamond-buy&amp;quot; or cash grabbing bullshits of sort).

I hate rejection so much. \nrecently I felt like life was getting better after I left hospital but then I stopped taking my medication, sleeping and eating properly. I\u2019m so afraid of my new upcoming psychiatrist appointment because I feel like they could be the most kind and understanding person but I still will find a way to find faults and eventually stop going to therapy",

Doing something \u201cfor attention\u201d is literally a necessary survival skill in childhood, and when a need isn\u2019t met, it can leave a kid totally helpless and in constant danger. It\u2019s the same for adults, too. It\u2019s just a human thing. People who are successful in business? Attention from clients. Successful on social media? Attention from internet users. Successful in friendships? Positive attention from healthy sources. \n\nY\u2019all would not (or would lol) believe how many people are driven in their disorders by a need to be noticed, communicate a problem that isn\u2019t being recognized with verbal cues, or the classic cry for help. Try it. Try being honest with a therapist that \u201cyeah sometimes I don\u2019t eat and starve myself because it feels like no one in my house pays attention and I want to see how long I can go before they ask when the last time I ate was.\u201d \n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a shit person or that you\u2019re making everything up. Anyone who tries to make you feel that way derives some sick sense of enjoyment out of kicking someone when they\u2019re down. Yeah, it\u2019s not the healthiest thing to do, but if we keep this stupid stigma up, more and more people are going to consider self destroying themselves into oblivion is the safer option.\n\nEdit: People have brought up some valid points that this post could be interpreted as a way to passively endorse and excuse outright, maliciously manipulative behavior. While I still don\u2019t feel it\u2019s productive for people to berate those who have perpetrated abuse and are trying to work on themselves (of course, I only mean those outside of a given situation who have not been victimized by said perpetrator), I certainly didn\u2019t aim for this post to coddle those who have performed maliciously manipulative acts. \n\nI specifically meant to refer to people who feel they have to use behaviors to communicate a need of theirs to other people. Manipulating another person is not communicating a need, it is bypassing another person\u2019s consent and right to autonomy in order to FILL a need, not convey it. One could argue that attention fills a need, but often attention is the precursor to a healthier conversation, and in a lot of cases that conversation is the ultimate goal. And I do believe that it is counterproductive and backwards to shame people for using whatever language is available to them to ask for help, when its entirely possible to gently listen and help that person map out a healthier, alternate language in the future.",

Doing something \u201cfor attention\u201d is literally a necessary survival skill in childhood, and when a need isn\u2019t met, it can leave a kid totally helpless and in constant danger. It\u2019s the same for adults, too. It\u2019s just a human thing. People who are successful in business? Attention from clients. Successful on social media? Attention from internet users. Successful in friendships? Positive attention from healthy sources. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Y\u2019all would not (or would lol) believe how many people are driven in their disorders by a need to be noticed, communicate a problem that isn\u2019t being recognized with verbal cues, or the classic cry for help. Try it. Try being honest with a therapist that \u201cyeah sometimes I don\u2019t eat and starve myself because it feels like no one in my house pays attention and I want to see how long I can go before they ask when the last time I ate was.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a shit person or that you\u2019re making everything up. Anyone who tries to make you feel that way derives some sick sense of enjoyment out of kicking someone when they\u2019re down. Yeah, it\u2019s not the healthiest thing to do, but if we keep this stupid stigma up, more and more people are going to consider self destroying themselves into oblivion is the safer option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: People have brought up some valid points that this post could be interpreted as a way to passively endorse and excuse outright, maliciously manipulative behavior. While I still don\u2019t feel it\u2019s productive for people to berate those who have perpetrated abuse and are trying to work on themselves (of course, I only mean those outside of a given situation who have not been victimized by said perpetrator), I certainly didn\u2019t aim for this post to coddle those who have performed maliciously manipulative acts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I specifically meant to refer to people who feel they have to use behaviors to communicate a need of theirs to other people. Manipulating another person is not communicating a need, it is bypassing another person\u2019s consent and right to autonomy in order to FILL a need, not convey it. One could argue that attention fills a need, but often attention is the precursor to a healthier conversation, and in a lot of cases that conversation is the ultimate goal. And I do believe that it is counterproductive and backwards to shame people for using whatever language is available to them to ask for help, when its entirely possible to gently listen and help that person map out a healthier, alternate language in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We were so rapidly falling in love, spending so much time together, he really seemed as obsessed with me as I was to him. I fell extremely hard, as you can imagine. Everything was perfect and beyond. But after just a month, he told me he needed some time alone to work on himself. \n\nSo there I was. Begging him not to leave. Begging a man that I've had in my life for a month and realistically speaking, barely knew, not to leave me. Crying hysterically next to him. Not being able to adjust my emotions to the reality. \n\nWhat happened next was spending my days crying, screaming and cutting myself for a whole month. Alone. Literally screaming and crying my heart out. For hours every night. Also I've made my worst scars ever. \n\nOver a person that's been in my life for a month. A fucking month. \n\nAnd to this day, I literally feel like I've developed PTSD-like symptoms about that whole situation.\n\nSo whose fault is it? Is it mine? Is it the illness' fault? Who is there to blame? Oh. No one.\n\nIt's so crazy how BPD twists up your emotions. And how long it took me to realize that this was indeed because of the BPD, and not because me and that man were soulmates.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the support! All your stories and advices really made me feel so much better and so understood. This is indeed an amazing community. Wish you all the best on your journey!",

I just need to get these feelings out because I don't know how else to deal with what I'm feeling. \n\nI just don't care about living anymore. I feel like that's the bare bones of it all. i don't care about being alive at this point.\n\nI broke up with my ex over a month ago, and combined with the pandemic I've been really disassociative, only coming back into reality to try to chase any kind of emotion. when I'm not sleeping for 12 hours I'm either jacking off or eating or watching youtube. that's pretty much all I've been doing. even after this quarantine I know I don't have much to rely on. yes, I have friends and family, but I think their mindset around me is \"don't let this person kill themselves.\" I've been DESPERATE to do things with them--play games, watch a movie, just freaking TALK and be HEARD--and it's been very slim pickings. I think my friends care but don't know how much I'm hurting. I know logically they can't know if I don't say anything, but I'm also like \"hey, I've threatened suicide in the past, maybe you should talk to me more.\" I'm afraid of coming off as manipulative if I ask them to talk to me because, when I spiral into an episode, I tend to become EXTREMELY manipulative. it's like a switch goes off; suddenly I'm not me anymore, I'm just a crying mess who is disassociating and trying desperately to self harm. \n\nI haven't self-harmed or attempted anything during the quarantine, mainly because I know my family would go horseshit. That's the only reason. i only don't give a fuck if I hurt myself--I don't live with anyone who would stop me now, so if anything I have more liberty to do it once this stuff is over. I don't have any real hobbies or passions to pursue, so why not? \n\nI've also been sexting guys online--a reason my ex and I broke up in the first place. I hate it. I hate hate hate hate hate how little control I feel I have over my sexual urges. I don't know what my gender or sexuality is anymore. it makes me want to throw up and then curl into a ball until I don't look like a human anymore. I don't want to be a person because then they don't have to deal with all these complications like how I present myself and how to deal with my emotions. \n\nI know I've done what I can to leave the relationship with my ex in a civil and friendly way--I apologized for what I did because I knew it was objectively wrong, and I shouldn't have done it. there's zero excuses for that, which just makes me feel more like a monster unable to control my urges. if I want to buy something, I buy it; if I want to have sex, I'll get off for hours on end; if I want something, I find a way to get it, even if I know I shouldn't. I chase emotional releases because I don't really feel I get a lot out of life. \n\nI don't know. I don't want to die; I just kinda want to black out and wake up in a reality where I feel the love and support I'm supposedly getting, where I'm proud of myself and have achievements to back that up. instead I just feel like an absolute waste. \n\nthe worst part about all of this is that I know after this spiral I'll bounce back up and be normal in a few hours, maybe tomorrow. I hate how quickly I can go from normal to \"let me go grab some razors l o l.\" I don't know how to healthily engage in things that feel good because, if I'm trying to learn something, it usually just makes me angry so I stop. \n\nI don't know what else to say in this post except that I am on medication and I do have a therapist. i haven't set an appointment for a skype session with her yet because I'm here with my family and I have a very strong urge to just cry and scream. I just want to die so badly and I'm too scared to do it. I feel like the biggest loser in the whole fucking world.",

I feel like that&amp;#39;s the bare bones of it all. i don&amp;#39;t care about being alive at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I broke up with my ex over a month ago, and combined with the pandemic I&amp;#39;ve been really disassociative, only coming back into reality to try to chase any kind of emotion. when I&amp;#39;m not sleeping for 12 hours I&amp;#39;m either jacking off or eating or watching youtube. that&amp;#39;s pretty much all I&amp;#39;ve been doing. even after this quarantine I know I don&amp;#39;t have much to rely on. yes, I have friends and family, but I think their mindset around me is &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t let this person kill themselves.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ve been DESPERATE to do things with them--play games, watch a movie, just freaking TALK and be HEARD--and it&amp;#39;s been very slim pickings. I think my friends care but don&amp;#39;t know how much I&amp;#39;m hurting. I know logically they can&amp;#39;t know if I don&amp;#39;t say anything, but I&amp;#39;m also like &amp;quot;hey, I&amp;#39;ve threatened suicide in the past, maybe you should talk to me more.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m afraid of coming off as manipulative if I ask them to talk to me because, when I spiral into an episode, I tend to become EXTREMELY manipulative. it&amp;#39;s like a switch goes off; suddenly I&amp;#39;m not me anymore, I&amp;#39;m just a crying mess who is disassociating and trying desperately to self harm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t self-harmed or attempted anything during the quarantine, mainly because I know my family would go horseshit. That&amp;#39;s the only reason. i only don&amp;#39;t give a fuck if I hurt myself--I don&amp;#39;t live with anyone who would stop me now, so if anything I have more liberty to do it once this stuff is over. I don&amp;#39;t have any real hobbies or passions to pursue, so why not? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also been sexting guys online--a reason my ex and I broke up in the first place. I hate it. I hate hate hate hate hate how little control I feel I have over my sexual urges. I don&amp;#39;t know what my gender or sexuality is anymore. it makes me want to throw up and then curl into a ball until I don&amp;#39;t look like a human anymore. I don&amp;#39;t want to be a person because then they don&amp;#39;t have to deal with all these complications like how I present myself and how to deal with my emotions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#39;ve done what I can to leave the relationship with my ex in a civil and friendly way--I apologized for what I did because I knew it was objectively wrong, and I shouldn&amp;#39;t have done it. there&amp;#39;s zero excuses for that, which just makes me feel more like a monster unable to control my urges. if I want to buy something, I buy it; if I want to have sex, I&amp;#39;ll get off for hours on end; if I want something, I find a way to get it, even if I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t. I chase emotional releases because I don&amp;#39;t really feel I get a lot out of life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know. I don&amp;#39;t want to die; I just kinda want to black out and wake up in a reality where I feel the love and support I&amp;#39;m supposedly getting, where I&amp;#39;m proud of myself and have achievements to back that up. instead I just feel like an absolute waste. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the worst part about all of this is that I know after this spiral I&amp;#39;ll bounce back up and be normal in a few hours, maybe tomorrow. I hate how quickly I can go from normal to &amp;quot;let me go grab some razors l o l.&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t know how to healthily engage in things that feel good because, if I&amp;#39;m trying to learn something, it usually just makes me angry so I stop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what else to say in this post except that I am on medication and I do have a therapist. i haven&amp;#39;t set an appointment for a skype session with her yet because I&amp;#39;m here with my family and I have a very strong urge to just cry and scream. I just want to die so badly and I&amp;#39;m too scared to do it. I feel like the biggest loser in the whole fucking world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

When I'm seeing someone, I can feel like I'm absolutely in LOVE with that person within days, and I can't help but constantly compliment, show affection to and put the person I'm seeing on a pedestal. The problem is, a possible result in doing such things is the person saying \"I want to take things slow\" or \"You're moving too fast.\" I hate hearing those words, and even though I know it doesn't mean they're trying to call it off, I always take it that way because I feel like my affection has just been rejected.\n\nI know I'm not entitled to have it be accepted by any means, but when I'm seeing someone and they say that, it makes me feel like right off the bat, I'll be the one to care more about that person than they care about me.  In turn, that makes me even more affectionate.  Even though I want to respect their boundaries,  it's like I can't control myself because I only know what one has to do in order to win *my own* love, I have no other clue how to win anyone else's.\n\nIt's like I don't understand how some people don't like being showered by affection by the person they're seeing.  I don't know any other way to keep someone interested without driving myself crazy with \"what ifs.\" Like, I read dating advice on certain relationship blogs but they all pretty much say the same thing, which is \"Don't be too available\" or \"Let them come to you.\"  Which I have always been absolutely horrid at doing. I always fear that if I don't continue to be open and available the person will just give up, get bored of me, or with time away from me decide that they really don't feel like being with me. It's even worse knowing that most of my concerns  are irrational but also thinking that I have every reason to be afraid all at the same time. My brain, and the way I think in general is a contradiction in and of itself.\n\nI know I sound selfish when I say I don't want to let them be long enough to decide that they don't want me anymore, and honestly, it is selfish.  It's just that I will grow an attachment to someone I've been intimate with for six days and feel like I've been head over heels for this person for six years.  It always feels like my relationships last longer than they actually do because the clock in my head feels... heavily distorted? And so because of this my attachment to this person is comparable to my attachment to people I've known my whole life, so I end up being terrified of losing them and unable to imagine what my life would look like without them.

My brain, and the way I think in general is a contradiction in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I sound selfish when I say I don&amp;#39;t want to let them be long enough to decide that they don&amp;#39;t want me anymore, and honestly, it is selfish.  It&amp;#39;s just that I will grow an attachment to someone I&amp;#39;ve been intimate with for six days and feel like I&amp;#39;ve been head over heels for this person for six years.  It always feels like my relationships last longer than they actually do because the clock in my head feels... heavily distorted? And so because of this my attachment to this person is comparable to my attachment to people I&amp;#39;ve known my whole life, so I end up being terrified of losing them and unable to imagine what my life would look like without them. DAE experience this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

You don't want to hear it nor do you care to, but you need to take care of yourself. \n\nWhen I first realized I might have BPD I immediately tried finding a subreddit, and within a minute of viewing the posts on here I had no doubt in my mind. It was so freeing, a gigantic weight was lifted off my shoulders, and I felt so loved without even having spoken to anyone. It'll probably forever be the most freeing experience of my life. \n\nI found great comfort in viewing the sub, but after a short while I started realizing that it wasn't giving me the same feeling it did before. Most posts that make the front page are DAE, while people actively struggling with something have their posts left pretty much unseen, as well as vent posts. \n\nSomething I realized with the music I listened to was that the emotional tracks I played could be split 2 ways. There's songs that move you forward, and there're songs that take you nowhere. Songs that keep you emotionally stagnant - they keep you in a place of pain instead of pushing you out of it, and a lot of times can start making you think a way you didn't before. That's what happened with me and this subreddit. When I first viewed it it gave me a massive push forward in the right direction, but upon viewing it on more lonely and sad nights I noticed it just kept me in the same place I was already in. This wasn't good for me. \n\nRecently I isolated myself completely, pulled the plug on all social media and taking time for myself. Truly. It has felt so good finally having a peace of mind. For the first time in my life I'm not taking shit from anybody. It seems like an insane concept but I do actually think once I'm done with this self growth that I truly will not need anyone anymore. I used to be the guy that would try and please everybody just for the hopes of making a meaningful connection and unfortunately people view you as lesser just because of that kindness. But self care is what a lot of you need. You need to take care of yourself. I sound like the stereotypical jackass that just thinks saying is as easy is doing, but 6 months ago there was literally nothing you could say to convince me that taking care of myself was what I needed to do to get better. I instead wanted to ruin my life further &amp; stay drowned in misery so it'd be easy enough one day to kill myself. But everything is one step at a time.\n\nThis post may seem confusing, but my point is not to make people stop viewing the sub - this post may not even apply to you - it's just think twice. Are you really going to feel better tomorrow because you chose to view the sub on a particularly sad/lonely night or is it just going to keep you at whatever low emotion you're currently feeling? Instead put on a song that's more upbeat. Or after you're done crying take some deep breaths and walk around a little bit. I constantly remind people that might be struggling with self care to always:\n\nBrush your teeth, take a shower, eat a meal. In that order. \n\nI know you hate yourself and are filled with an equal amount of regret but you will eventually come to love yourself like I now do. Whenever you read things like these, someone from a high place telling you things can get better, your immediate thought is that whatever they experienced must not have been as bad as you, or that they simply just got lucky. I'm the same as you, I have BPD, I've made my mistakes, I've lost the only person I love, I've lied to avoid hospitalization, I've made detailed plans on how I was going to go out, I've felt the physical weight of all the emotional pain I was feeling, I've felt the heat and intensity of the anger I've frequently felt, I have been there. Just know that taking care of yourself, taking the steps needed to make yourself better, doesn't invalidate the pain you've endured and it most certainly doesn't mean you're letting go of someone if you're not ready to yet. I still miss her. Some nights are harder than others. But I wouldn't trade having this peace of mind for nearly anything.",

PEOPLE DONT WANT THAT. they want to just stay in mild contact with me so they can say they didnt completely fuck me off. because everyone's too much of a pussy to actually fuck people off when they dont like them. \ni am mad im still mad because i am so mistreated always. i am always fucking bending myself for someone to love me. to give me an ounce of attention and love and it doesnt matter. cause they dont care. \ni dont know who i am or what i want. this quarantine is making it harder too. but one thing i decided for sure. i will NEVER let myself get played like i got played before. i will not wait for someone's text. i wont fucking cry about someone when they clearly dont even have me as a 10th fucking choice. i am done i will not bend my personality whatever it is to suit anyone anymore. i dont care about it anymore. i am what i am. i am ever changing i am turbulent i wont let anyone ever shame me for that. hope someone understands this feeling.",

Kreisman\n\n\nBorderline personality disorder is not simply a psychiatric condition or a mental health disorder, BPD is so much more, because it is a\u00a0personality disorder,\u00a0meaning that it is enduring, pervasive, debilitating, and affects every aspect of one\u2019s life, it cannot be viewed, understood, or treated simply like any other psychiatric disorder. BPD is a\u00a0personality adaptation\u00a0formed over the course of early childhood. It is a faulty set of coping mechanisms and behaviors which while perhaps beneficial to the infant and young child in enduring and surviving an impossible childhood marked by unbearable circumstances, this adaptation has no place in the world of adults.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis is much like the young borderline who was forced to adopt a certain set of behaviors as an infant/child in order to survive in a chaotic unpredictable early environment.\n\nHe was forced to over-idealize his parents.\u00a0\n\nHe was forced to view the world in black and white.\n\nHe was forced to divide his world into Angels and Devils\n\nHe was forced to view the world as a dangerous place.\n\nHe was forced to view others with great distrust. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nHe was forced to believe that everyone would eventually abandon him,\n\nAnd most significantly he was forced to view himself as unworthy, undeserving, and even unlovable.\n\n\nIt is difficult to imagine just how badly a person would have to be hurting psychologically that they would be willing to cut into their flesh with a razor blade or a piece of glass. But this is the reality of this disorder and those who suffer with it. As some borderlines have said,\u00a0feeling the pain on the outside of the body is much easier to deal with than feeling the pain on the inside.\n\n\n\u201cMy skin is so thin that the innocent words of others burn holes right through me.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2015 BPD Pieces of Me Community\n\n\nSource Material: NIMH.gov, NEA for BDP, Goodreads.com, 2019",

I was getting better, my relationships were getting better, I was doing great at work. I had things sorted... then she had to come back.\n\nNow my disassociation, negative thoughts, and memory issues are coming back, bad enough that my work has took notice of my memory loss and have had to take me aside to ask what's wrong, because my work life now is a complete 180 from the happy, energetic, focused person I was. She's been out of my house since September, and I'm still getting random angry outbursts and disassociative episodes.\n\nAnyone that has memory issues or can sympathize, is there anything you do that helps? I'm currently in talk therapy, doing CBT and DBT on my own (with guidance from my therapist), and am on medicine (my memory hasn't changed or gotten worse since starting my medicine).

I had things sorted... then she had to come back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now my disassociation, negative thoughts, and memory issues are coming back, bad enough that my work has took notice of my memory loss and have had to take me aside to ask what&amp;#39;s wrong, because my work life now is a complete 180 from the happy, energetic, focused person I was. She&amp;#39;s been out of my house since September, and I&amp;#39;m still getting random angry outbursts and disassociative episodes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone that has memory issues or can sympathize, is there anything you do that helps?

It gets to a point where I&amp;#39;ll feel like I want to die, like actually die, and that&amp;#39;s the only thing that will make me happy. I think about how tedious life is and how I hate cleaning my apartment and how I hate maintaining my body and how meaningless things are and i just spiral.
